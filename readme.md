# TagKick

Untag Facebook photos with one click.

Find it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tagkick/hnbgophbdhcjoihcpmafgemiikkadkgm).

# Manual Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ankane/tagkick.git
```

Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome, choose "Load unpacked extension", and select the cloned directory.

# Limitations

Due to Facebook's design, you can't untag yourself in your own photos at the moment.
